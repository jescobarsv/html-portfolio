    <h3>Spider-Man (2002)</h3>
    <p>
    The original movie, great all rounder popcorn flick! 
    <br><b>9/10</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Spider-Man 2 (2004)</h3>
    <p>
    The best one of the "Sam Raimi Trilogy", it builds and improves upon the first one. 
    <br><b>10/10</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)</h3>
    <p>
    Somewhat criticized but it's still a fun experience and has its own twist on the Green Goblin seen in the Raimi Trilogy. 
    <br><b>7/10</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse (2018)</h3>
    <p>
    Amazing fells short, a true masterpiece of animated comic book movies. A great time for all the family! 
    <br><b>10/10</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Spider-Man Homecoming (2017)</h3>
    <p>
    The first official Spider-Man movie made from Marvel Studios, quite entertaining and more grounded to the Comics. 
    <br><b>8/10</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Spider-Man No way Home (2022)</h3>
    <p>
    The one that ties it all in, having watched the rest this one hits way different! 
    <br><b>10/10</b>
